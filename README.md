Repository for work done regarding API Development

# About this repository:
This repository will be used to host all the work done for Project 2 - API Development.
<br />Note that this project will be finished in the near future and this repo will be updated shortly. 
<br />In order to assist me in completing this project succesfully, I have designed a board to imporve on my time management and planning.
<br />I still want to complete this project, as I'm looking to obtain the training and experience of API Development provided by this project.

I have extended the due dates for the issues remaining of this project. Reason being that my machine is having a lot of trouble with processing, and consistantly throws out a bluescreen of death.

# About my API:
<br />I took the code first approach in developing my API.

<br />**In my DeviceController.cs i've implemented the following functionalities:**
<br />&emsp;[HttpGet] - That retrieves all the devices in the database, as well as only per device ID.
<br />&emsp;[HttpPost] - Create a new device entry on the database.
<br />&emsp;[HttpPut] - Used to update a device specified by the device ID.
<br />&emsp;[HtttDelete] - Used to delete a device specified by the device ID.

<br />**In my ZoneController.cs i've implemented the following functionalities:**
<br />  [HttpGet] - That retrieves all the zones in the database, as well as only per zone ID.
<br />  [HttpPost] - Create a new zone entry on the database.
<br />  [HttpPut] - Used to update a zone specified by the zone ID.
<br />  [HtttDelete] - Used to delete a zone specified by the zone ID.

**Note:** I will continue to perfect my API, since there are still errors persisting while using Swagger or Postman.
